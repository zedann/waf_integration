## Slide 5: Machine Learning Models
**Two AI Models Working Together**

**🤖 Model 1: DDoS Detective**
- Analyzes 30 network patterns
- Detects traffic floods and connection attacks
- Speed: 5-10ms per request
- Accuracy: 95.2%

**🤖 Model 2: Content Inspector**
- Examines request content for malicious code
- Detects SQL injection and XSS attacks
- Speed: 8-12ms per request
- Accuracy: 98.7% (SQL), 97.1% (XSS)

---

## Slide 6: How It Works
**7-Step Security Check**

```
1. Request Arrives     → Apache Server
2. Basic Check         → ModSecurity Rules
3. Feature Extraction  → 45 Security Features
4. AI Analysis         → Two ML Models
5. Decision Making     → Combine Scores
6. Action Taken        → Block or Allow
7. Logging             → Security Events
```

**⚡ Total Time: <110ms**

---

## Slide 7: Attack Detection Process
**Real-Time Threat Analysis**

**🔍 What We Monitor:**
- **Network Level**: Connection patterns, traffic spikes
- **Application Level**: Request content, parameter values
- **Behavioral**: User patterns, timing anomalies

**🎯 Detection Examples:**
- SQL Injection: `1' OR '1'='1` → BLOCKED
- XSS Attack: `<script>alert('hack')</script>` → BLOCKED
- DDoS: 1000 requests/second → RATE LIMITED

---

## Slide 8: Testing Results
**Real-World Attack Simulation**

**🧪 Tests Performed:**
- SQL Injection attacks (1000+ variations)
- XSS attacks (500+ patterns)
- DDoS simulations (SYN flood, Slowloris)
- Performance stress testing

**📊 Results:**
- **Detection Rate**: 96.7%
- **False Positives**: 2.3%
- **Response Time**: <110ms
- **System Stability**: 100% uptime

---

## Slide 9: Performance Impact
**Security vs. Speed Trade-Off**

**✅ What We Gained:**
- 96.7% attack detection
- Real-time threat blocking
- Adaptive learning capability
- Comprehensive security logging

**⚠️ What We Lost:**
- 20% slower response time (8-15ms vs 2-5ms)
- 10-20% fewer requests per second
- 200MB additional memory usage

**💡 Bottom Line: Small performance cost for huge security gain**
